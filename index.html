      <main><article><div><h1 id="about-me">About me</h1><p>I love learning programming languages and and building well designed software. There is something almost magical when you see a well written program or a new feature in a computer language that just “fits”. I’ll never forget the first time I looked at a LISP macro or a finally understood (as much as you can understand)” a monad; spine chilling and exhilarating. The first time you build your solution with containers and suddenly realize years of fighting with configuration differences are gone in the blink of an eye: cathartic.</p><p>I’ve developed production software for nearly 8 years - from business case analysis, to design and team lead, to developer, to solution architect and a bit of Dev Ops sprinkled in. In that time, I’ve tried to take the good ideas I’ve seen and introduce them into production software to improve quality and general reliability.</p><p>My background is a bit different from your typical developer. I am a qualified actuary. I was a statistics/computer science undergrad and I ended up sitting for the actuarial exams and getting hired by a consulting firm - but over the nearly two years there, I spent the majority of the time building and maintaing risk adjustment software written in SAS and Java.</p><p>From there, I went to work in a more traditional insurer as an actuary for about 3 years before being hired back to a consulting firm, but again to build actuarial and analytical software. Over the past 6 years I’ve been a developer, solutions architect, product owner of various software products (internal pricing software and consumer facing decision support products) and served as a team lead for our innovation hub in Singapore (50 actuaries, developers and data scientists). I recently moved back to Denver to take on a role developing rapid protoype products and modernizing our team’s Dev Ops stack and coding standards.</p><p>In terms of technologies used in production, the majority of my work has been with C#/.Net stack and Angular/React, but I’ve managed to slip in some Clojure for backend processing (yes you can do that when you’re the boss) and used Pharo Smalltalk to prototype a few APIs before converting them to C# in production. I’ve also used R professionally (and python a bit) for our data intensive projects and am a huge fan of Docker, Elixir (still learning) and Rust (still haven’t found a use case at work for it yet). </p><p>I have an on again/off again relationship with Haskell and Common Lisp. Having cut my teeth on a risk adjuster and pricing software where the penalty of errors was high, I naturally love testing, specifically property based testing and I’ve spent enough time hunting down hidden mutation to appreciate the functional paradigmn (though I’m slightly obsessed with reconciling true OOP - like Smalltalk - and functional programming).</p><p>While software development is a passion, I can’t completely abandon my actuarial roots. I also like to think through how best practices from the development and data science world can be “ported” over to actuarial land and be applied to improve how actuaries work.</p></div></article></main>
